If you hit a certain amount of numbers then you win. What makes Cleopatra Keno more fun over standard Keno is that you have a chance for the Bonus, which if hit, gives you 12 free plays with double the payouts!\r\n\r\nWhile maintaining the familiarity with the casino game, our iteration has several extras; Background Music, updated Sound/Graphics and a complete Statistical Database that tracks your play. Plus...A Horror Themed version with chilling music/sound, a dark overlay and creepy crawlies abound.\r\n\r\nCleopatra Keno is a pay once application. For only $1.99 you get the full game and all updates that come down the pike for free.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDJ2S5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Star Shipping Inc.","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35799.9007199266483866.13f05447-4c2f-4bec-b178-7171b6726050.d2bb8dea-1418-4eee-9043-a06f4f033eff","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56477.9007199266483866.6bfd36b5-24ae-48b1-9351-289eac63e0aa.a7c244bd-bc1d-40ba-ae3a-72d8c68181f8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["6D0669D6.31597E28EE017_qvtjws96jvq8y"],"ContentIds":["df335699-d0d3-d622-a429-5afb91c00a8d","f96c04f9-ee3e-54ac-f82b-c01fb8469ec1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Telemóvel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Travel through space and get rich with Star Shipping Inc.

First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKKWF","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Simply Pinochle","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38717.9007199266525172.4a78381e-78b3-49fa-b756-5387507cee85.fcdaf380-1722-447b-b0ce-8d91c582c542","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.29","Price":2.29,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["38236CardsFun.SimplyPinochle_wvhqmvdkxmhhc"],"ContentIds":["f298a4df-668f-bd36-9fe4-055b49d2cd1c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pinochle is an exciting and challenging game of cards very popular in the U.S. This is the two handed version of the game in which you play an intelligent robot.

Aces are considered low, they can form a set with another aces but only the low end of runs. A Gin Rummy player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all the sets, all runs, or both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal Gin. \r\n\r\nDeveloped specifically for the the Phone and Tablet with an intuitive interface, Gin Rummy will be a pleasure to play and pass time anywhere, anytime.

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy. Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold. The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving. You also have the option of seeing your opponents’ cards during the deal! \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or enjoy the program, please let us know!

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy.

Symptoms can include light-headedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, momentary loss of awareness, and loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.\r\nImmediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these\r\nsymptoms. Parents, watch for or ask children about these symptoms— children and teenagers are more likely to experience these seizures. The risk may be reduced by being farther from the screen; using a smaller screen; playing in a well-lit room, and not playing when drowsy or fatigued. If you or any relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before\r\nplaying.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH42L8N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"OpenDarts","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60294.13510798887899003.4028720a-c924-4640-8a03-43c934e0852d.525ae601-551a-4212-812e-8c2c9a1b7fd8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48047.13510798887899003.9987d5de-a1df-428a-8ffe-d06c4e8823cc.efe2547d-da66-43c3-997f-422e84dc02d6","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$3.99","Price":3.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["35254RicardoMartinsAlves.OpenDarts_petrj02892ffm"],"ContentIds":["8b186f16-7be0-9dfc-002c-b8b216923b39","7c90e514-b71e-bf45-52dc-9d58d2b2b60e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Telemóvel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"OpenDarts is a software that manages darts from a dartboard.

It's also a great way for grownups to clear one's mind, or get into that trance or meditative state when thoughts can ramble around as they want.  \r\nYou can play Wall Ball in standard mode, with a pretty fast ball, or in easy mode with a rather large and slower moving ball, or you can even play in seated mode, suitable for people with some physical impairment or if you just feel very tired.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need the Kinect Adapter for Windows. After installation of the Kinect software you should be able to see the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Wall Ball game.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed and you have tested a good spot for playing where the Kinect sensor can \"read\" you properly, see above under \"Technical stuff\". If you have two graphic cards on your system, run the game with the better card otherwise it can affect Kinect/game performance. (For example, if you have a nvidia card you can manage this in nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings.)\r\nStart the game by pressing the Wall Ball icon.\r\nFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants Standard or Easy version or if you would like to sit down and play, choose Seated mode. The ball is somewhat larger and slower in Easy and Seated mode.\r\nWith the Toggle Show Settings (down at the right corner), you can adjust for your camera's placement above the floor. It is recommended to fine tune this. If the camera height setting are too low, you will feel like your feet are really heavy and won't lift properly. If it's to high, your feet will float in the air. The camera height slider correspond to the Kinect sensor's placement above the floor, however if it is tilted, you may have to adjust the slider more.\r\nStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, start kicking.\r\nKick the ball by using your right or left foot. When aiming, remember this is virtual reality so aim in a real world scale, not just in a small tv screen scale, that is, play like you were in the park yourself facing a large wall about 4 meters in front of you.\r\nIf the ball touches the area right behind you (an area as wide as the yellow area you're standing on) you will lose one ball. \r\nTo prevent the ball from hitting this area, you can stop the ball with your \"body\", shown as a silhouette, or just use your feet. You can slide from side to side inside the yellow area and crunch (you can't really move forward or backward, only as far as your legs can reach).\r\n\r\nIf you have lost all of your five balls, the game will end and you can choose to save, restart or exit. You choose between alternatives by putting your foot in one of the boxes, in this way you can restart instantly if you would like without the need to reach for the computer. You can also click on the signs with the mouse. From the Start screen, you can click on Result Menu where you can view your results.\r\n\r\nVideo tutorial: https://youtu.be/qFTv-q2cccg\r\nPDF tutorial: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5X43G","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"TriPeaks Solitaire#","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11265.13510798886383599.15fd2d67-715e-4899-9319-65f7c4401489.eb14e5da-c829-4aa4-a84a-a449206711f4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23488.13510798886383599.ebb40c79-1e7a-480e-b5f3-7e00a85e4a86.9849c242-efe1-438f-9545-70c1864e3c7d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["41169ZTLLC.TriPeaksSolitaire_xzsreqmkr4cme"],"ContentIds":["0effe09f-4f26-7822-e481-87632cc9f633"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you can pass all levels of this game, you are the best tripeaks solitaire player.   \r\n\r\nBest Tri-Peaks Game.

There are three different variations of the game, BubbleWalk, PokerWalk and BingoWalk. You move along the road by walking in place, like a leisurely march. At the same time, you can do some playing tasks with either your right or left hand. In BubbleWalk you pop some bubbles as you walk along the road. Count how many bubbles you can pop. In PokerWalk, you are presented with ten cards along the road, you can pick five of them, you cannot change or return a card so try to choose wisely to get a good poker hand at the end of the road. If you have something on your hand, you can save the result, so if you want, you can try to collect different types of hands. In BingoWalk you control a magic beam with your hand. Find the five Bingo objects along your way, and aim your beam at the objects to collect them. But be careful, the objects will start to drift upwards as soon as you point your beam at them. If you get Bingo, you can save your time result.\r\n\r\nTYPE OF GAME\r\nThe Country Ramble Games are intended both as recreation and as a way to get exercise in a simple way. Note that these are not extreme action games. Country Ramble Games can be played by people with impaired mobility as well as people who want a little more than an ordinary walk, just level the step height button. The step height button determines how high you need to lift your feet or knees to get around. You can change the step height level to your preference. At the lowest setting it's easy to get around, this may be a good setting for elderly or people with some kind of mobility impairment. There are no time limits, if you feel like it, you can stop and rest outside the mediaeval chapel and listen to some hymns, you can turn down the game music volume and just listen to the birds, or why not pump up the step height level and turn the music volume up and get a really good exercise. Of course, you don't actually need to \"play\" anything if you don't want to, just walk and relax.\r\n\r\nWHO CAN PLAY\r\nThis game can be played by anyone who wants to take a leisurely walk or stroll in the countryside, one can even \"walk\" sitting down which makes it useful for elderly or for people with some form of mobility impairment. For those who want a more intense and difficult march, increasing the Step Height level will for sure make the pulse go up.\r\nThe games are simple in their design and will suit people also with less experience in computer gaming. The games are intentionally made to be cognitive non-demanding to suit people in need for relaxed activities. They may be a good choice for people with cognitive difficulties, such as in stress related fatigue syndrome where attention can be easily overwhelmed by stimuli, or for people with brain fatigue or minor dysfunctions caused by stroke. There are no \"bells and whistles\" in the games, at least very little, the scenes takes place in nature in a calm environment and the music consists of a mix of old folktunes (walking tunes), classical pieces with a somewhat modern arrangement. (Generally, \"Country Ramble Games\" were designed to be less stressful and less physically demanding than some common motion games.) The games has been developed with the support of psychological expertise. \r\nAs results can be saved and viewed in plotted graphs or in high score tables, the games could also be useful in a clinical context, such as in stroke rehabilitation and physiotherapy, since you can easily view progress in training. And the games can hopefully be a fun way of training a weak leg or arm. In such cases, discuss game playing with your medical advisor. For people suffering from problems with balance or mobility impairment such as weakness in legs, one can play sitting down.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer.

Try to pop the bubbles by reaching out at them with your hand.\r\n•\tPokerWalk: Ten cards will be placed along the road. try to get a poker hand by choosing wisely. When you're in reach to pick a card, a little sound can be heard.

Once you picked a card you cannot change it. If you don't want a card, just pass it. When you've picked five cards, you cannot pick any more card. The type of hands you can get (in order of value) is; one pair, two pairs, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, and royal flush. If you get some of those hands and your cards are high you can also get bonus points added to the total sum. Both the type of hand and the total sum will be recorded if you choose to save your results.\r\n•\tBingoWalk: Five objects will show up on the panel at the bottom of the screen. As you walk along the road, try to spot those items (sometimes they are easy to see, sometimes not so easy). When you find them, point your magic beam towards them and they will start to float upwards. To catch the objects, hold your beam so it turns red, try to follow the object with your hand so the beam keeps being red for about 3 sec.  If you catch it, it will be checked in your panel. Tip; try to get close to the objects, at long distances or far to the sides, it can be hard to point and keep the beam steady enough.

Some people say that the love could last for a long period while the process of being in love and the romance are quite short, especially if we don't make certain acts that will keep that romance alive. Maybe that is the secret of those older couples that are still in love and walk hugged together, even though they have spend many, many years together.\r\n\r\nConnie for example is happily in love with her husband for many years. She is a very romantic person and knows how to cherish and keep the love. She always finds interesting ways how to celebrate their love and keep it alive but there is one thing she hasn't done yet. Namely, Connie has always wanted to go together with her husband on an exotic island and spend a romantic weekend there. Her husband knows about her wish so one day he surprises his wife with a journey to Jamaica. Well, what can be better that that?! Spending some time alone in a wonderful place, enjoying the unique nature, the unique music and meeting new people while getting to know a new civilization... simply great!\r\n\r\nThey are already at the place. Connie is really happy and she likes to take a walk in order to explore this beautiful and romantic

They actually like to prove that the pyramids are older than it was thought before. That's why they take their team of scientists and start exploring the structure of the sand on the Sphinx.

The game is safe for all ages but comes without all the distractions that games for kids usually have. Anyone with a taste for puzzle and mind games should give A Game of Lines and Nodes a try. The game does not require any special permissions in your device, works offline and has no ads.\r\n\r\nThe game involves playing with lines and dots (we call them nodes) but is far from being a simple connect-the-dots game. A Game of Lines and Nodes combines elements of Hashi or Hashiwokakero (橋をかけろ, literally translated to “build bridges!”), plus some features that make it unique, engaging and relaxing.\r\n\r\nThe game is somewhat similar to Hashi in that the nodes have a required number of connections and in that lines cannot jump over nodes or other lines. However, nodes here are 'floating' and can be dragged around freely. Also, there can only be one connection between the same two nodes, unlike Hashi where there can be up to two.\r\n\r\nAs the nodes get connected, polygons and figures takes form, helping you to determine if you are in the right track to solve the puzzle. Just watching nodes react to each other as they are dragged around contributes to the relaxed environment and is quite entertaining.\r\n\r\nThere are no timers in this game, or any other element or mechanic that will make you feel rushed or under pressure. You can take as long as you like to complete a level, you can even save the state of a puzzle and complete it in more than one play sessions.\r\n\r\nA Game of Lines and Nodes is designed to be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. You can test your might by playing a level without any help and you may succeed, specially after you are more experienced. However, help is always available if you choose to use it.\r\n\r\nThere are no ads, no subscriptions and no in-app purchases. Also, the game is safe for all ages and  the simple interface and controls will appeal to both young and mature audiences.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played in English, Spanish or Chinese (中文) and the language can be changed at any time from the Welcome screen. \r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n  • Easy to learn and play but challenging\r\n  • Relaxed no-rush environment\r\n  • No ads, no subscriptions, and no in-app purchases\r\n  • No internet connection needed to play\r\n  • Does not require special permissions in your device\r\n  • Safe for all ages\r\n  • Clean and minimalist user interface\r\n  • Option to pause and continue later\r\n  • Original game elements like unbreakable connections, incompatible nodes and more\r\n  • Almost impossible to get stuck in a level with the help system\r\n  • Over 50 challenging levels\r\n  • Background selection and an option to mute sounds\r\n  • Can be played in English, Spanish or Chinese

When women go to work, they spend about eight hours there, and after that they have the same responsibilities at home and sometimes a quick lunch or a take away meal could do its job. However, people usually are not that tolerant for the moms that don't go at work. Since they are at home, everything is supposed to be in a biggest order. The house should be perfectly clean, the lunch should be always ready on time, the children should be always satisfied and same goes for the husband. That means a lot of work but when a person says that she was at home all day, it seems that she takes a lot of rest, that she has a lot of time for herself, but how could that person have time for herself when she is always taking care for someone else?!\r\n\r\nThis commitment is usually a pleasure but let's not forget that every mom needs some time for herself, some time to spend with her friends, time to do something just for her, to work on herself...\r\n\r\nDoris for example is a wife and mother of two.
