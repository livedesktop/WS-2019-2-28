These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear color gradients and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. Embedding and optional tracing of raster graphics is also supported, enabling the editor to create vector graphics from photos and other raster sources. Created shapes can be further manipulated with transformations, such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape\r\n\r\nYou can support Inkscape! https://inkscape.org/en/support-us/donate/","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PDQNK3X76H6","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Gmail Search For Cortana","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58025.14145201812562351.516596e8-d020-472e-a612-dae996f575f9.6de42034-6965-41b0-b19c-8ca5d96149a9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58795.14145201812562351.061d42b6-efbd-4692-8481-45df80d183e1.8f3ff5ad-bcf8-4469-a08e-f35777d32e66","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51486.14145201812562351.5f3097dc-98a0-43fd-977f-6f6c48dbe0fa.92b43383-c0e9-427b-b7c2-d39a9a8514db","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28463.14145201812562351.4d7fc427-d5db-46f4-aaa4-56158123650d.6d347ed0-af36-4743-b421-c5be0b1863fa","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26443.14145201812562351.2ce8f6ed-0395-40ed-9ca7-b68fc449b1b1.b39fe084-2742-456a-b217-943eed40a8ce","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40662.14145201812562351.92f87820-9c32-4feb-b9bd-5e760041510b.0a2fd490-5a36-4699-a7a7-5e8c6b22ebf1","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28156.14145201812562351.9ea1b393-4258-4eaa-9214-e8639e9d9f0d.a310981a-c3b8-438e-9b68-dab57d22cacb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58681.14145201812562351.49945126-ba2c-42b4-9905-be94a4ab7833.30b064bb-4b2f-45be-859f-4f413f95c614","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49793.14145201812562351.ea44b45f-07d3-483d-90a8-362f0ddfee3d.324a2d61-d103-4eed-8a36-a302e52139ad","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5211.14145201812562351.3954fc07-9083-4fba-8b6e-1e108854342e.bb8cf464-e304-402a-8e0e-5087796b708c","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["JensGormRye-Andersen.361114E7A4C92_4z475mn9jbxw2"],"ContentIds":["ca5fd247-ceda-53ad-88ca-05dc9df23b1e","af8d74b0-88f9-ae1e-ca23-da949c0802b4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"   ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Search your Gmail right from the start menu, powered by Cortana!

We are working to update this to NP++ 7.6 as fast as possible. However there have been significant changes in the way plugins are handled with 7.6 - and we really want to bring the Plugin Admin experience to you. Please bare with us as we work through the technical challenges while maintaining store compliance !!!\r\n\r\nThis is an (unofficial) Open Source fork of the original Open Source Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to get notepad++ in the store. All functionality remains the same however there are some features that dont work due to store policy, or are limited (like some file associations, and the run options). This is a published centennial application. All Credit to the original Notepad++ team, all the heavy lifting of creating an awesome app was done by them.\r\n\r\nThis is currently Notepad++ version 7.5.9 (updated in this update)\r\n\r\nCode and changes required for publishing is located here: https://github.com/NightRi-se/notepad-plus-plus\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n1.   Default Plugins can not be removed or updated\r\n2.   Custom plugins CAN NOT be loaded AT ALL on Windows 10 S (on other versions of windows, it is possible to load them from %appdata% - but ensure your plugin version matches your build version [x86/x64]).\r\n\r\nWe are working on including a selection of plugins by default for future versions. Current we have included MarkdownViewer++ and Compare plugins by default.\r\n\r\nNotepad++ is a free (free as in both \"free speech\" and \"free beer\") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several programming languages and natural languages.

Art Computer Graphics (ACG).\r\n\r\nApp is FREE without function limitation!

Play files on Media Server (API not supported by phone system). \r\nSimple & Green. \r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\nCurrently it uses simple UI, you can custom panel buttons. Since it's still under development, functions can change (add/remove, FFmpeg DLL may update and change) at any time.  And currently I won't add more languages(hard to maintain).\r\nThis app is just a lite player, I do not write decoder, it uses system(sdk component) and free FFmpeg(unmodifiable, under LGPL) to decode data automatically.  I think it should support system player default formats, but I don't know how many does FFmpeg(WinRT) support. It should support most common formats, but it will not support all formats, just try, if not supported, I can do nothing to it. . The target of the app is to show my new tech & features for media playback, not to support as many formats as possible.
