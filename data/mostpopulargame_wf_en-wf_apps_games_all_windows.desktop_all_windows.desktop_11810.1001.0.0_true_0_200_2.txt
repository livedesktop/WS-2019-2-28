Our flappy friend migrated to another amusement island further in the south, where you can find the coolest mini golf tracks placed on an exotic beach.  Many trucks are littered with old clay pots that could obstruct your way.  Smash them to free your way to the hole. As the bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented some parts of  the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations\r\n- 4 amazing courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive par\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible fruit like, bananas and water melon to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. If you can make it with no more than 3 par (hits) you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible bananas and Water melon slices that can increase your final score.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one water melon piece you will get back one par (hit) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nJoin this crazy bird on his holiday at the beach and have some real fun playing this epic game.\r\n\r\nChallenge your friends and show them who the king of the trucks

planet.\r\nYou will be a lovely employee of this big kinder garden where you will have to take care of many hyper active children.\r\nYour task is to make them feel at home and to make them sleep once in a while. The problem is that there are always new children coming into the room that want to play, run, jump, scream and just don’t want to keep quiet. Try to make these noisy babies sleep and have a sweet dream.\r\nTo make the babies sleep you will have to tap on those having the same pajama and see them disappear in a love blast. It is basically a match 3 game. The difference is that you will have to be very quick in finding the right combinations as the room is getting too narrow to keep so many babies. If you are too slow the babies will not be able to get any rest. Keep an eye on the babies light status while playing to understand if you are doing well or if the room is getting jam packed and the babies are not able to get their nap anymore.\r\n\r\n★★★Features: ★★★\r\n- Match 3 or more identical babies\r\n- Colorful graphics and smooth animations\r\n- 15 levels to play\r\n- Realistic baby sounds\r\n- Maximum points reachable with one move: 300\r\n\r\nUseful advice: You need to match at least 3 tiny babies to get points, if you touch just 2 of them they will disappear and empty the space they occupied before, but without giving you any points.\r\n\r\nWarning: If you touch in a place where no matching babies are, you will lose 50 points.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile you are proceeding through the levels, you will find a more and more messy room. In fact there will be toys spread all over the floor which will restrict the living space of these nice little kids, such as a ball, a colorful ring tower, a yellow duck, a green rubber hedgehog, a tender teddy bear etc. Try to master all the levels of this cute baby game and become the best nanny that this sunny kinder garden has ever had.\r\nUse all of your love to make these tiny babies sleep and make them vanish in a sweet heart blast.\r\n\r\nThis Babsy baby style app is a great baby game / kids game and one of the best children games!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDD0DX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dragon Revenge","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1657.9007199266379939.76a504bb-648f-4e28-858b-954057221570.69fe7b73-8697-41d9-a9a9-a89a0f8bad78","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#820302","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36520.9007199266379939.d7547691-d8e8-4ba6-90ef-3a2881577ac6.1328c85b-2da1-48ee-a02b-fd477af6e41d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#820302","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22502.9007199266379939.02f3b219-ea3e-4e62-bc49-d3dc4f494979.4b796de2-91bb-4e04-93f3-185b650438ed","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#820302","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46061.9007199266379939.27579307-0a45-47bb-9fb0-46c66f685535.d3aca191-b363-4e80-8cb0-b1b084c4d89a","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#820302","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["ArelloMobile.DragonRevenge_c6nyd5cf8dkgm"],"ContentIds":["a6d51b23-e00e-0704-b92e-2e8a07692941"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Burn it all!

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5Q57J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Rescue Helicopter 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38109.13510798887145681.1115fb21-582c-4861-b263-06c6ed22397d.0819531c-0c4e-4fef-bb59-6dc3951f6b56","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45211.13510798887145681.bc25ae37-eb65-44ae-a9e8-79974b9b4132.27ea5bac-d344-4da1-bca8-35210c3eb13c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["1723SimulatorGame.RescueHelicopter3D_1heq8fxsacfx4"],"ContentIds":["c88cdfe8-1707-34be-2e34-d3bd030436a9","4fce1b3a-39b6-4705-8c8b-de1ceda43124","bf6dd008-8f3c-a3a8-84f9-4591fc664f32"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Rescue Helicopter Simulator 3D Game is finally here!! \r\n\r\nRescue Helicopter Simulator 3D is one of the most realistic Helicopter Simulator on the Windows 8/8.1/10 Store.\r\n\r\nSmooth Controls and realistic physics makes it a game to experience once. \r\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for?
