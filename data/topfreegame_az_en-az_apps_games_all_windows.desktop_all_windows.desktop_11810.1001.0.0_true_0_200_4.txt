It doesn't know what has transpired in the wake of the fall or why the world has become so rowdy and violent, all it knows is it hasn't made an arrest in 1230 years and it's got some catching up to do. As it takes in the sheer number of people rioting the earth, the copbot's cloning activates and as he travels beyond the borders of his rebirth, his clones spawn and reign their strict laws over the town. As one of the world's last remaining superheroes, working a desk job at the local precinct, when a mob of copbots storm the district, taking out citizens left and right, he knows he must take a stand and classes from this menace. \r\n\r\nCops Vs Robbers - Survival Craft is a thrilling first person shooter adventure where you can enjoy real time battle with friends and foes from all over the globe. With over 40 weapons to create, equip and use including guns, rockets, grenades, bows, swords and gems, you'll be ready to blow past enemies with stunning finesse. Take out enemies creating or utilizing a plethora of unique strategies or even shoot through walls when you see oncoming enemies approaching on the areal entity map. Collect your daily reward by viewing short video ads, then select your difficulty level and begin fighting. In this initial map, you will be fighting against the clock in order to earn a powerful permanent weapon to carry with you throughout the game. The level will instruct you in the number of enemies you'll need to defeat and the time you'll be given to perform this feat. If you don't succeed the first time, you'll be offered another chance, or you can move on to the next level without this bonus weapon. When you reach level six you will unlock the multiplayer option.

\r\nMeet one of the most entertaining birds on the planet.  Our flappy friend migrated to another amusement island further in the south, where you can find the coolest mini golf tracks placed on an exotic beach.  Many trucks are littered with old clay pots that could obstruct your way.  Smash them to free your way to the hole. As the bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented some parts of  the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations\r\n- 4 amazing courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive par\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible fruit like, bananas and water melon to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. If you can make it with no more than 3 par (hits) you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible bananas and Water melon slices that can increase your final score.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one water melon piece you will get back one par (hit) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nJoin this crazy bird on his holiday at the beach and have some real fun playing this epic game.\r\n\r\nChallenge your friends and show them who the king of the trucks is!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,
